### A distributed video server project, to better replicate the public airwaves online

In this collection, I'm freely sharing an idea I previously documented for transmitting video more freely across the web.

Specifically, the "innovation proposal" here was generated as part of an application for Stanford University's Knight Journalism Fellowship in 2014. I've decided to share it freely because, while not much came of the idea originally, I think it's still relevant to the video ecosystem of 2018. In fact, it recently struck me upon re-reading the proposal that the problems it delineates have only gotten worse since I originally wrote the document.

At the time, this propsoal made it to the semifinalist round of Stanford's selection process for Knight fellows, placing it in the top 10 percent of applications the program received that year. I ultimately got cut in the next round of the selection process, but hey. No hard feelings.

I'm hoping the proposal may still be useful to creators who are as concerned as I am that online video has become so locked-down. If you have feedback on my idea, or if you'd like to start building software based on it, please feel free to use this GitHub repo (https://github.com/indizr/vidfello) as a collaboration space. I'm also reachable via the contact information below.

My original proposal here is shared under Creative Commons 4.0 license. I've also tentatively included a GPL 3 license in this repo to cover any code that contributors may want to add.

Cheeers,
